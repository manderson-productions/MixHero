When adding the Allegro Frameworks, for some reason the "AllegroMain" framework doesn't show up in the available
frameworks. 

Follow the instructions here until you get to the Add Frameworks section:

http://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=OSX,_Xcode_4,_Framework

THEN:

1. Add the available Allegro Frameworks.

2. Add another framework and choose "Add Other"

3. Navigate to: Developer -> SDKs -> MacOSX 10.x sdk -> Library -> Frameworks ->
- and choose AllegroMain-5.0.framework (don't navigate to headers, just choose that folder and hit open).

ALSO:

It is important to use the following arguments in the main function or else you will get the _al_mangled_main error:

int main (int argc, char **argv) {

}

-I know this is the case with any .cpp not sure if I tested on a .c file though. Alright!

FREEING MEMORY

-anytime you allocate memory using one of the following:
ALLEGRO_DISPLAY *display = NULL;
ALLEGRO_EVENT_QUEUE *queue = NULL;
ALLEGRO_TIMER *timer = NULL;
ALLEGRO_BITMAP *image = NULL;
ALLEGRO_FONT *font = NULL;

display = al_create_display(WIDTH, HEIGHT);
queue = al_create_event_queue();
timer = al_create_timer(1.0 / FPS);
image = al_create_bitmap(WIDTH, HEIGHT);
font = al_load_font("arial.ttf", 18, 0);

-you need to free the memory before exiting the game loop using the following:
al_destroy_display(display);
al_destroy_event_queue(queue);
al_destroy_timer(timer);
al_destroy_bitmap(image);
al_destroy_font(font);
