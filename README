Enjoy.

This was a first on many fronts; game design and collaboration on a project. The code is pretty messy and in retrospect 
see lots of things we can improve upon in the future.

For Future Reference when using Allegro 5.xxx:


When adding the Allegro Frameworks, for some reason the "AllegroMain" framework doesn't show up in the available
frameworks. 

Follow the instructions here until you get to the Add Frameworks section:

http://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=OSX,_Xcode_4,_Framework

THEN:

1. Add the available Allegro Frameworks.

2. Add another framework and choose "Add Other"

3. Navigate to: Developer -> SDKs -> MacOSX 10.x sdk -> Library -> Frameworks ->
- and choose AllegroMain-5.0.framework (don't navigate to headers, just choose that folder and hit open).
